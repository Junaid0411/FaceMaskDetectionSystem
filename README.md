# Face Mask Detection System
As the human race continues to expand and strengthen, new variations of viruses and diseases also become more prominent; it is imperative to build on existing technology and expand on current knowledge to protect humanity from these life-threatening viruses. 

Recently, the world has witnessed a global pandemic caused by the COVID-19 virus. To limit the spread of this virus, enforcing specific measures such as social distancing, hand hygiene and using personal protective equipment (PPE) is highly advised. Face masks are one of the most effective ways to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus, and as a result, countries have mandated the use of face masks in many public areas (WHO 2020). However, ensuring compliance with this mandate has proven challenging, ultimately making developing a face mask detection system necessary.
